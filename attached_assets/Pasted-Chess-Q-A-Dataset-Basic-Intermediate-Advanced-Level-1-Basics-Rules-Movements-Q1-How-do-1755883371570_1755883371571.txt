Castle early for king safety.

Connect rooks by moving the queen out.

King’s Pawn Opening: 1.e4

Queen’s Pawn Opening: 1.d4

Sicilian Defense: 1.e4 c5

French Defense: 1.e4 e6

Level 4 – Tactics (Short-Term Tricks)

Q16. What is a fork?
A16. A fork is when one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time.

Q17. What is a pin?
A17. A pin is when a piece cannot move because it would expose a more valuable piece (usually the king/queen) behind it.

Q18. What is a skewer?
A18. A skewer is when a valuable piece is attacked, and after it moves, a less valuable piece behind it is captured.

Q19. What is a discovered attack?
A19. A discovered attack happens when one piece moves, revealing an attack from another piece behind it.

Q20. What is a sacrifice?
A20. A sacrifice is when you deliberately give up material to gain a tactical or strategic advantage (like checkmate).

Level 5 – Strategy (Long-Term Planning)

Q21. What are the 4 steps of move analysis?
A21.

Safety First – Is my king safe? Any threats?

Piece Activity – Are my pieces active?

Tactics – Look for forks, pins, skewers.

Strategy – Control the center, improve positions.

Q22. When should you exchange pieces?
A22.

To simplify when you’re ahead in material.

To reduce your opponent’s attacking chances.

Avoid exchanges if your opponent benefits more.

Q23. What is the importance of pawn structure?
A23. Pawns shape the battlefield. Weak pawns (isolated, doubled, backward) are targets. Strong pawn chains give control and space.

Q24. What are open, semi-open, and closed positions?
A24.

Open – Few pawns in the center, lots of piece activity (good for bishops).

Closed – Pawns block the center, requiring pawn breaks (good for knights).

Semi-open – One open file for rooks to control.

Q25. Why is king safety important?
A25. An unsafe king can be attacked quickly. Castling helps by moving the king away from the center and activating a rook.

Level 6 – Endgames

Q26. How to checkmate with king and queen?
A26. Use the queen to push the enemy king to the edge, bring your king closer, and deliver mate with the queen supported by your king.

Q27. How to checkmate with king and rook?
A27. Use the rook to cut off ranks/files, push the enemy king to the edge, and bring your king close for the final checkmate.

Q28. What is opposition in king endgames?
A28. Opposition is when two kings face each other with one square in between. The side not to move has the advantage.

Q29. What is the square rule in pawn endgames?
A29. Draw an imaginary square from the pawn to promotion. If the enemy king can enter this square, the pawn can be stopped.

Q30. Why are passed pawns important?
A30. A passed pawn has no enemy pawns blocking its path to promotion, making it a strong winning asset.

Level 7 – Advanced Concepts

Q31. What is zugzwang?
A31. Zugzwang is when a player is forced to move, but every possible move makes their position worse.

Q32. What is prophylaxis?

Q34. What is the difference between tactical and positional play?
A34. Tactical play is about short-term tricks and combinations, while positional play focuses on long-term advantages like pawn structure, weak squares, and piece activity.

Q35. What is a fortress in chess?
A35. A fortress is a defensive setup where the weaker side builds a position that the stronger side cannot break, leading to a draw.
