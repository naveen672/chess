No pieces between king and rook.

Neither king nor rook has moved.

King is not in check, and does not move through/into check.

Q8. What is en passant?

A11. Checkmate happens when the king is in check and cannot escape by any legal move. The game ends immediately.

Q12. What is stalemate?
A12. Stalemate occurs when the player has no legal moves, but their king is not in check. The game ends in a draw.

Opening Questions

Q13. What is the best first move in chess?
A13. The most popular first moves are 1. e4 (pawn to king’s fourth) and 1. d4 (pawn to queen’s fourth), because they control the center and open lines for bishops and queen.

Q14. Why is controlling the center important?
A14. Controlling the center (d4, d5, e4, e5) gives your pieces more mobility and restricts your opponent’s options.

Q15. What is development in chess?
A15. Development means moving your pieces from their starting positions to active squares where they can control the board. Knights and bishops should be developed early.

Tactics

Q16. What is a fork in chess?
A16. A fork is when one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time. Knights are especially good at forking.

Q17. What is a pin in chess?
A17. A pin is when a piece cannot move because moving it would expose a more valuable piece behind it (usually the king or queen).

Q18. What is a skewer in chess?
A18. A skewer is when a valuable piece (like a king or queen) is attacked, and once it moves, a less valuable piece behind it can be captured.

Q19. What is a discovered attack?
A19. A discovered attack happens when one piece moves, revealing an attack from another piece behind it.

Q20. What is a sacrifice in chess?
A20. A sacrifice is when you deliberately give up a piece to gain a tactical or strategic advantage (like checkmate or winning material later).

Strategy

Avoid exchanges if it helps your opponent.

Q23. How can you checkmate with king and queen?

Q24. How can you checkmate with king and rook?
A24. Use the rook to cut off ranks/files and push the enemy king toward the edge. Bring your king closer and use your rook for the final checkmate.

Q25. What should you do if you are losing material?
A25. Look for counterplay (tactical chances, counter-attacks) or aim for stalemate/draw tricks if winning is impossible.
